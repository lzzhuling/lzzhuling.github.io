== About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE), Georgia Institute of Technology, working with Professor [https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~yxie77/ Yao Xie], and collaborating with Professor [https://services.math.duke.edu/~xiuyuanc/ Xiuyuan Cheng] at Duke University. I received my Ph.D. in Operations Research in 2024 from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) under the supervision of Professor [https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~manchoso/ Anthony Man-Cho So]. Before that, I received an M.S. in Computational Mathematics in 2020 and a B.S. in Mathematics in 2017 from Zhejiang University, where I was advised by Professor [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wXOSCJ0AAAAJ Chong Li]. Additionally, I worked as a research assistant at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University from February to May 2019, under the mentorship of Professor [https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/profile/xqyang/ Xiaoqi Yang].
